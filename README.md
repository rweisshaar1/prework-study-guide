# Study Guide Website for the U of M Coding Bootcamp 2023

## Description

- The motivation behind creating this basic website, was to assist the user in studying the 3 basic web development languages: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, along with Git. What better way to study, than to use the languages, and apply them in making a study guide website.  
- The purpose of the website, is to learn the basic web building languages, along with having a resource to study the languages.
- By accumulating all of the knowledge I have learned in one simple website, I have fixed the issue of organizing all of the information needed to study for the bootcamp.
- I learned all about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, along with implementing Git flow to the project. I believe this will help me in the bootcamp, and in my professional coding career as well.
